# Altair: Custom Commands for Discord Bots

Collection of custom commands for various Discord bots, including YAGPDB.

> In _Stargate SG-1_, Altair is a planet occupied by sentient android duplicates of humans trying to make their world a better place.

Though this repo may grow to contain custom commands for other Discord bots, for now the only bot around is [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz).

If you have an idea for changes, updates, or even a new set of custom commands entirely that you'd like to share with the community, please know that **[contributions are welcome](https://github.com/rp-magrathea/altair/contribute)**!

## Why YAGPDB?

I've personally found YAGPDB's custom command structure more comprehensive and capable than alternatives like Carl-bot and Atlas (both of which I tried to use for the Question and Answer tooling before discovering YAGPDB).

## What's Included?

Commands are housed in [`dist`](/dist), each under a directory matching the bot they go with. From there, each command has its own directory, including details and instructions.
